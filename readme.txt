Makes styling of Contact Form 7 forms easy – even if you don’t have HTML + CSS skills.

== Description ==

Contact Form 7 is one of the most popular WordPress plugins ever. It is used by millions of websites around the world. Creating a basic contact form with Contact Form 7 is quite simple. But creating complex forms with many fields, and getting them to look how you want, can be difficult for many WordPress users. 

Experienced WordPress users, skilled at using HTML and CSS, are able to style their Contact Form 7 forms to their particular requirements, but this requires a level of skill beyond many WordPress users.

This is where CF7 Skins comes in. It works right inside the normal Contact Form 7 interface to extend its capabilities, making it easier for regular WordPress users to create forms using built in Templates and Styles.

Simply select a Template from a list of available templates and then choose a Style for your form from a range of professional and beautiful styles.

CF7 Skins is highly customizable and easy to use even for beginners.

Plus you can do all this and more without HTML and CSS skills.
